# Project: PHP Test

## Backend Test
This repository contains PHP code for managing promo tiles on a website's frontend. Each promo tile includes a title, image, and description text. The backend operations allow for adding, editing, listing, and removing these tiles using PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and MySQL.

## Front End Test
The frontend includes HTML and CSS files that build a responsive webpage displaying 3 promo tiles. Each tile features an image, text, a link, and a button. Clicking the button reorders tiles, positioning the clicked tile first. Additionally, clicking "more details" opens a modal with placeholder text. The design leverages Bootstrap and jQuery to ensure compatibility across all devices and viewports.
